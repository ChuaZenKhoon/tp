## Product Information

Hi:Re is a **desktop app for managing your employee details,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

*Meaning:* Most work is done via *typing* :white_check_mark: commands on a command line instead of *clicking* :x: with your mouse :computer_mouse:!

- **Fast-typers**, Hi:Re will be your **best assistant** to get your contact management tasks done
  **faster** than traditional GUI apps.

- Regardless of your *technical skill* level, our User Guide will **bring you up to speed** and **quickly master** Hi:Re, that is already **streamlined for HR purposes**!

<box type="info" seamless> 

**<u>NOTE</u>:exclamation:**
**In Hi:Re, we adopt a system where contacts are identified by their email identity (ID for short) without the company email domain.** <br> 
The ID is **case-insensitive** and **accepts special characters**, but **NOT whitespaces**.

Example: John is identified by his ID, `john123` without the domain, @123company.com

Hence, we <u>allow duplicate names and handphone numbers</u>.
Contacts are also required to be labelled with <u>minimally one</u> mandatory tag.
</box>


<u>Breakdown of commands</u>:
1) Account Management: Register, Login and Logout
2) Data Manipulation: Adding, Deleting, Editing a Contact and Clearing all Contacts
3) Data Observation: Toggling the Display, Finding Contacts by name, Listing all matching information 
4) Command Management: Undoing and Redoing a Command 
5) Data Portability: Exporting to .csv file
6) Link to our User Guide, Exit Hi:Re

1. Run this command, `java -jar HiRe.jar`, to start the application.<br>
   A graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.<br>

   <box type="info" seamless>Do note that the app contains sample data / contacts.</box>

   <img src="images/ui/startUp.png" width="452.5" height="369.5"><br>

## Commands

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `()` are the parameters to be supplied by you, the user.<br>
  e.g. for `- /id (id)`, `(id)` is the parameter to be supplied by you. Input a similar command as follows into the command box: `- /id johndoe69`.

* Words in `{...}` are optional and may be repeated.
  e.g. in  `> /id (id) /tag (tag) {/tag (more tags)..}`, the second `/tag` parameter may be excluded, or repeated as many times as you want.

* When using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to Hi:Re.
</box>

#### Disclaimer for Account Management Features (Register, Login & Logout)

While our Account Management Features may imply that our product is a multi-user product,
we would like to clarify and assure you that Hi:Re is a **single user product**.

Companies often form partnerships, collaborate and share resources.

Therefore, as an HR employee, you may be required to use **multiple address books** to effectively manage employees and partners from different companies.

To **safeguard the information of each company**, the use of multiple address books, locked behind different user accounts and passwords, is **essential**.

  * The `name` should only contain **alphanumeric** characters and spaces, and should not be blank.<br>
  i.e. Names containing non-alphanumeric characters such as Rui-En or Ravi S/O Balakrishnan are not supported for the current version.

### Editing a contact: `>`

When the employees updates their information, you can edit their details in the addressbook.<br><br>
Format: <code> > (id) /name (name) /hp (handphone) /tag (tag) {/tag (more tags)...}</code><br><br>
Example: <code> > johndoe41 /name John Joe /hp 98765432</code><br>

  <box type="important" seamless>

* The `ID` of the contact must be inputted first. The order of the other prefix and field sets are interchangeable, so you are able to input the details in any sequence.<br>
The `/id` prefix is **not used** in this command. 

* Fields to be edited are optional, but **at least 1 field** must be given, excluding `ID`. `ID` is used to identify the contact.

* If the all fields match the current contact's fields, the edit command will still go through and not give a duplicate person error message. This is due to our unique identifier ID.

* Should you wish to edit the `ID` of the person, please **delete** the contact and **add** the contact with the editted `ID`. 

* The `name` should only contain **alphanumeric** characters and spaces, and should not be blank.<br>
i.e. Names containing non-alphanumeric characters such as Rui-En or Ravi S/O Balakrishnan are not supported for the current version.

* The `phone number` should **only contain numbers**, and it should be **at least 3 digits long**.

* **Only one** `phone number` is allowed for the current version.

* Excessively long fields will be text-wrapped appropriately.

* When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed (i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative).

### Clearing all contacts:  `clear`

When you want to reset your addressbook, you can clear all contacts from the current addressbook with this command.<br><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Toggling the display: `$`

You can toggle the display to view / hide the contacts panel of Hi:Re. 
This gives you a **cleaner and less-cluttered** application workspace and allows you to focus on entering the commands, especially if there are many contacts.<br><br>
Format: <code>$</code><br>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
You can also use this command by clicking in the `View` section of the menu bar.

</div>

  <box type="important" seamless>

* When your contacts panel is hidden, commands that show a list of contacts (like `ls` or `?`) will consequently **not appear to do anything**.<br>
Thus, if your result of one of these commands is unexpectedly empty, try toggling the panel and re-entering the command again.

Handling an addressbook with many contacts does not necessasrily mean an increase in difficulty in searching for a specific contact. Using the `?` command, you can find all contacts in the addressbook that has names containing the keyword(s) entered.<br><br>
Format: <code> ? (keyword) {(more keywords)...} </code><br>

<box type="important" seamless>

* All names consist of **alphanumeric** characters, hence any <u>non-alphanumeric characters used will result in no contacts found</u>.

* All names containing the `(keyword)` entered will be matched.<br>
E.g `? jo` will give `John` if John exists in the address book.

* When more than one `(keyword)` is entered, all names that match with **any** of the keywords will be listed.<br> 
E.g `? jo a` will give `John` and `Ali` if both of them exists in the address book.

* `(keyword)` used to match names are **CASE-INSENSITIVE**.
  </box>

Example:
  <box type="definition">
    Finding with one `(keyword)`: <code> ? al </code><br>
    <img src="images/ui/find/1.png" width="452.5" height="350.5"><br>
  </box>

  <box type="definition" theme="info">
    Finding with more than one `(keyword)`: <code> ? al ch </code><br>
    <img src="images/ui/find/2.png" width="452.5" height="350.5"><br>
  </box>

<div style="text-align: right;">
  <a href=#table-of-contents>

    </a>
  </div>

### Listing all matching information: `ls`

Similar to the find, `?`, function, you can add filter the contacts by tags! 

The `ls` function serves multiple purposes. You can list all matching information in the addressbook, list all tags or filter the contacts by tags.<br><br>
Format: <code>ls (args)</code><br><br>
<code>(args)</code> = <code>-a</code>: List all contacts in the address book. <br>
<code>(args)</code> = <code>-t</code>: List all tags available. <br>
<code>(args)</code> = <code>(tag_name) {(more tag_name)...} </code>: List all contacts with any <code>(tag_name)</code> specified. <br>

<box type="important" seamless>

* All tags consist of **alphanumeric** characters, hence any non-alphanumeric characters used will result in no contacts found.<br>
* When more than one `(tag_name)` is entered, all tags that match **any** of the words will be listed.<br>
E.g `ls H fin` will list all contacts with tags containing `H` **OR** `fin`.<br>
* `(tag_name)` used to match tags are **CASE-SENSITIVE**.

  </box>
Example: 

  <box type="definition">
    <code>-a</code>: List all contacts in the address book.<br>
    Command: <code>ls -a</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/list/image1.png" width="452.5" height="369.5"><br><br>
  </box>

  <box type="definition" theme="info">
    <code>(args)</code> = <code>-t</code>: List all tags available.<br>
    Command: <code>ls -t</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/list/image2.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box>

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

  <box type="definition">
    <code>(tag_name)</code>: List all contacts with ONE <code>(tag_name)</code>.<br>
    Example: <code>ls H</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/list/image3.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box>

  <box type="definition" theme="info">
    <code>(tag_name)</code>: List all contacts with MORE THAN ONE <code>(tag_name)</code>.<br>
    Example: <code>ls H fin</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/list/image4.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box>

    </a>
  </div>

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Adding a tag: `tag+`

You can add tags to categorise contacts to your liking! With the `tag+` function, you can customise the contacts of employees with their departments or other relevant information.<br><br>
Format: <code>tag+ (tag_name)</code><br><br>

<box type="important" seamless>

* Default tags: `HR`, `operations`, `finance`, `marketing`, `IT`, `sales` & `RnD`

* Tags are **MUST** be **alphanumeric**.

* Tags are **CASE-SENSITIVE**.
  </box>

Example: 

 <box type="success">
    Adding the tag <code>CEO</code>: <code>tag+ CEO</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/tag_plus/1.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box>

**How to handle error when adding tags?**<br>
<u>Duplicate tag error</u>: When you add a duplicate tag, the error will be triggered.

  <box type="wrong">
    Duplicate tag error. <br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/tag_plus/2.png" width="452.5" ><br><br>
       </box>
  

<div style="text-align: right;">
  <a href=#table-of-contents>
    back to top
    </a>
  </div>

---
<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Deleting a tag: `tag-`

You can delete an irrelevant tag from the tag list with `tag-` command. This prevents the cluttering of tag list with irrelevant / not-in-use tags.<br><br>
Format: <code>tag- (tag_name)</code><br><br>

<box type="important" seamless>

* A tag cannot be removed if a contact is tagged with the tag-to-be-removed.
  </box>

Example: 

 <box type="success">
    Removing the tag <code>HR</code>: <code>tag- HR</code><br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/tag_minus/1.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box>

**How to handle error when deleting tags?**<br>
<u>Tag still in use error</u>: When you try to delete a tag that is still in use, the error will be triggered.

  <box type="wrong">
    Tag still in use error. <br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/tag_minus/2.png" width="452.5" ><br><br>
       </box>

<div style="text-align: right;">
  <a href=#table-of-contents>
    back to top
    </a>
  </div>

---
<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Undoing a command: `undo`

Did you make a mistake? Fret not, you can undo your previous action / command and restore the address book to the state before the previous **undoable** command was executed.<br><br>
Format: `undo`<br>
<box type="important" seamless>

* **Undoable commands**: those commands that modify the address book’s content ([add](#adding-a-contact), [delete](#deleting-a-contact), [edit](#editing-a-contact) and [clear](#clearing-all-contacts-clear)). 

* All other commands (including adding and deleting tags) **CANNOT** be undone _(as of the latest version)_.

* `undo` does not revert the [deletion of sample data](#deletion-of-sample-data-upon-first-addition).
  </box>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
You can also use this command by clicking in the `Edit` section of the menu bar.

</div>

Example:<br>
1. Delete the person with the ID `johndoe41` using command: `- /id johndoe41`.<br>
2. `Undo` the deletion. The person will reappear.<br><br>

* **Confirmation of successful undo**<br>

  Upon undo-ing a command successfully, you will see a similar GUI as illustrated below.<br>

  <box type="success">
    GUI upon successful undo command <br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/undo/1.png" width="452.5"><br>
  </box> 

* **How to handle error when undo-ing a command?**<br>

    1. No undoable command error: If there is no more executed command that can be undone, and you attempt to run the undo command, the error will be triggered.<br>
       <box type="wrong">
       No undoable command error <br><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Redoing a command: `redo`

You can reverse the most recently undone command. This is helpful when you `undo` the command unintentionally.<br><br>
Format: `redo`<br><br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tip**<br>
You can also use this command by clicking in the `Edit` section of the menu bar.

</div>

Example:<br>
1. Delete the person with the ID `johndoe41` using command: `- /id johndoe41`.<br>
2. `Undo` the deletion. The person will reappear.<br>
3. `Redo` the undone deletion. The person will be deleted again.<br><br>

* **Confirmation of successful redo**<br>

  Upon undo-ing a command successfully, you will see a similar GUI as illustrated below.<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

### Exporting data: `@`

You can export the data in the addressbook to a comma-separated values (`.csv`) file in the same directory Hi:Re is in. This is especially helpful when you require the data to be used on another platform that supports the widely accepted data file (`.csv` files).<br><br>
Format: `@ /filename (filename)`<br><br>
Example: `@ /file contacts`<br>

<box type="important" seamless>

* Note that you **need not** add the `.csv` file extension to the filename argument when executing this command.<br>
i.e. Hi:Re will do this for you! Hence, the command `@ /filename contacts` will export the data to `contacts.csv`.
  
* The filename should follow standard filename conventions on your system. (e.g. no special characters)

* If a `.csv` file already exists with the given filename, the command will **not** execute and an error will be thrown.
</box>

**Confirmation of Successful Export**<br>

   Upon a successful export, you will see a similar GUI as illustrated below..<br>

  <box type="success">
    GUI upon successful export command <br><br>
    <img src="images/ui/export/afterExport.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
  </box> 

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> \pagebreak </div>

* **How to handle errors when exporting data?**<br>
  1. <u>Invalid filename error</u>: If you have provided an invalid filename for your current system, the error will be triggered. You can search up and follow the specific filename requirements for your system.<br>
      <box type="wrong">
      Invalid filename error <br><br>
      <img src="images/ui/export/invalidName.png" width="452.5"><br><br>
      </box>

  1. <u>Filename already taken error</u>: If you have provided a name that is a duplicate of a `.csv` file exisitng in the same directory as the program, the error will be triggered.<br>
      <box type="wrong">
      Filename already taken error <br><br>

## Design Philosophy

Our software development team has meticulously crafted this application to provide
you with a seamless and intuitive user experience.
At the heart of our design methodology lies a commitment to simplicity, efficiency, and user-centricity.

**Dark Blue UI for Enhanced Comfort**

Our application features a sophisticated dark blue user interface, carefully chosen to promote relaxation and reduce eye
strain during extended usage sessions. We understand the importance of creating an environment that is both visually
appealing and gentle on the eyes. By embracing dark blue as our primary color scheme, we aim to enhance your overall
experience and encourage prolonged engagement with the application.

**Toggle Display Option for Streamlined Navigation**

Navigating through large amounts of contact data can be overwhelming. That's why we've implemented a convenient toggle display
option, allowing you to effortlessly hide or reveal extensive contact data sets with a simple click. This feature empowers you
to customize your viewing experience, providing flexibility and control over the information displayed on your screen.
Whether you're focusing on specific details or seeking a clutter-free interface, our toggle display option ensures seamless
navigation and enhanced productivity.

**Command-based Data Entry System**

We believe in minimizing unnecessary mouse usage and maximizing efficiency in data entry tasks. Our application boasts
a streamlined command-based data entry system, designed to simplify the input process and minimize user effort.
By leveraging intuitive keyboard commands, you can swiftly navigate through fields, input data, and execute commands
with precision and speed. This approach not only accelerates contact manipulation tasks but also reduces cognitive load, allowing
you to focus on your workflow without distractions.

**In summary**, our application's design methodology is guided by a dedication to user comfort, efficiency, and accessibility.
From the calming dark blue UI to the streamlined command-based data entry system, every aspect of our design reflects our
unwavering commitment to enhancing your productivity and satisfaction.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. Sample data sometimes does not clear if it is edited **before** a new contact is added. As such, we recommend that you add a new contact immediately upon first logging into Hi:Re **before** executing any other commands.

3. **When your contacts panel is hidden**, commands that show a list of contacts (like `ls` or `?`) will consequently not appear to do anything Thus, if your result of one of these commands is unexpectedly empty, try toggling the panel and re-entering the command again.

4. Currently you cannot directly recover passwords of your accounts. If you forget the account password for a certain addressbook, please open `accounts.txt` and delete the whole line with the username of that addressbook. Then, you can launch the application and `register` an account with the **same username** to access the original addressbook. Apart from this, please do not arbitrarily edit the .txt file, as this may cause account information to be read incorrectly or even cause the application to fail to start.

## Future Integrations

**In the future, we plan to integrate some of the following features:**

1. **A more rigorous account management system**, which will allow you to manage users as an administrator, and assign different levels of authentication or security to the different personal data collected.

2. **A remote database management system**, which links all Hi:Re instances on different machines to the same Hi:Re database. This will allow you to collaborate with other Hi:Re users! There are more benefits to having a database system in place.

3. **More open-ended tagging and field options**, allowing for Hi:Re to be fully customisable by you as per your organisation's requirements.

4. **Multiple phone numbers**, you to add in both the employees' office and personal phone numbers to the same contact.

5. **Improving input acceptance**, will allow you to be more flexible with the case-sensitivity and characters when it comes to `name`s and `tag`s.
